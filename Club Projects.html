        <h3> Current Projects </h3>
    <ul id='projectlist'>
        <li><u>Internal website:</u> Creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS with a login for club members</li>
        <li><u>External website:</u> Creating this website from scratch using HTML and CSS for anyone to learn about the club</li>
        <li><u>BonAppeteam CWRU Nutrition App:</u> Our ultimate aim is to empower students to make informed decisions about their diet, leading to healthier lifestyles and overall well-being
            <ul id='projectlist'>
                <li>Our project focuses on creating a comprehensive nutrition app using React Native, specifically designed for students at Case Western Reserve University. Our goal is to offer a seamless mobile experience that guides users towards healthier meal choices within the university's dining options.</li>
                <li>The app features a user-friendly interface that allows students to easily browse and select meals based on their dietary preferences and nutritional goals. Behind the scenes, we're developing a sophisticated algorithm that considers multiple factors in determining the healthiness of a meal. These factors include calorie count, macronutrient balance, presence of key nutrients, and adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) dietary recommendations.</li>
                <li>By leveraging the university's meal plan data and integrating real-time menu updates, our app ensures that students have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information. Additionally, we're incorporating user feedback and engagement features to continually improve the app's recommendations and user experience.</li>

        <li><u>Bootleg Fantasy:</u> Bootleg Fantasy aspires to use machine learning to generate the MVP in the National Basketball Association. By using public datasets, data analysis and visualization techniques, and the random forest model we can model the MVP selection process. There are also plans to have this function/product be displayed and accessible by a website.</li>
        <li><u>Image Encryption & Decryption Software:</u> Our group is creating a project using Python, particularly its Pillow library. We are creating an algorithm to uniquely encrypt an image with a user-selected message by altering its pixels. We are writing one program to encrypt the image, and another to decrypt the image based on a unique key passed to it. The decryption algorithm will output the original message back to the user.</li>
